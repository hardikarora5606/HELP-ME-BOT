# help-me-bot-bennett

*Introduction*

We are making an app that will help the students with their problems inside Bennett university it will be a chat-bot style application. It'll specially be a helpful app for the fresher's and parents who are not aware of how things work in our university

Problem
Our main problem that we are dealing with in this project is that student’s and parents are unaccustomed to the university in their 1’st year and they couldn't ask anyone about their problems as they are new to the university and don’t know where to go.

Solution
So taking in the problems that are being faced by our fresher’s and parents and with our experience with the problems we’ve developed a virtual assistant that help’s our freshmen and parents to get the solution to their problem so easily even though they find some difficulty to ask someone

OVERVIEW
Techniques Utilized

User Interface/Demo Snapshots

Conclusion
Currently, there are no similar applications that have been implemented like ours. There have been students from different universities that have thought of it and some have even written a paper on this application, but there aren’t any applications that are in any way similar to the one that we are creating this semester. So if we can develop this perfectly it would be great for all the people In our university.

Future Work
So in our future work we could integrate this app with Google Maps so that it would be easier to navigate in our college instead of getting automated message directions and we would also try to add a voice integration to that so that it could make up a complete Chabot in our future.
